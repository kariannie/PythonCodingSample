Python Coding Sample 

This is a shortened version of my final project for INFO 1998, a class run by the Cornell Data Science project team at Cornell. In this project, we utilized techniques such as preprocessing, manipulation, and creating visualizations, and finished by building machine learning models to run predictive analysis on our dataset.
